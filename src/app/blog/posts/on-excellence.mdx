summary: 'Reflection of myself on goals setting and striving for excellence'

# Intro

Excellence, a term that I'm quite certain it is not too uncommon to encounter it somewhere in our life. Especially with the rise of social medias, small to big influencers,
it seems to become evasive under various forms that you can substitute with: ambition, success, the best of the best. Ultimately and intrinsically,
we as humans want to head towards our goals with excellence.

# Vicious Cycle

It is such a pleasing feeling to hear, talk about these and imagine a picture encompassing the promises of joy, fame, proudness, admiration, prodigy that the endings bring, isn't it? Reality,
like a sneaky friend, however, is honestly brutally real and great at slapping us. An observation:

- We are presented with a seemingly cool prospect.
- Then we immerse ourselves into that thing with a series of planning, and more preparing or waiting for a suitable moment to act.
- Then we act which I consider it already a small win.
- If we are lucky enough to have time as well as motivation for improvement to stick with the things long enough to see results , otherwise we might start dabbing between another ideas/options/visions.
  The cycle repeats until ones find it boring/disheartening/discouraging due to countless reasons that ones decide to either temporarily or forever abandon these wonderlands.
  I don't see anything bad or wrong with these wonderlands as they are the motivations for ones to become better, and these things are beautiful and great.

# Problems

The most prevalent problem is most aim for the destination without consciously considering or unknowingly underestimate the journey, efforts, and obstacles it requires to get there
not even counting being good at doing the things. Even worse, we tend to think there is a magic pill, a secret hack, a definite guide that will lead us there. Additionally,
"there" is relative as like most things because "there" requires us to keep maintaining, improving at some levels so that it will not fade away.

Excellence and goals are great-to-have terms in our dictionary with a little cute reminder before attempting reading these definitions. Here is my current reminder: Good things takes time
and deliberate practices with a good enough feedback loop which comes from the environment, from people, from the result at each stage.
As always for things we do, after the initial hype, it is quite intimidating journey ahead so it is better that we have tools under our belt to use.
Following thoughts are some of the most essential ones that I formed through years of accumulation in my life to help remind myself and embrace the journey during the hard time, as it always comes.

# Starting

First and probably the most important and hardest one is simply "starting". Prior researching is necessary as long as you are aware of analysis paralysis to avoid the pithole.
Reflecting to the day I started training martial art is the reminder for myself that starting does not require as much as I tend to think.
I don't wait until I lose some weights to improve my stamina and endurance for learning martial art. In facts, it is vice versa, I must start training and learn from people there who are in good form to improve my condition.
I don't have to perform at the level that the better people perform but need to show the commitment and the willingness to finish the katas.

Until now, I do feel this same thing applies to daily tasks of our job, and things that we store in our todo list and this is still my weakness ü´†.
One more thing is the day I started my programming journey in the JavaScript world. I know little JavaScript before and the first task at my first job is to use React.js which I know nothing about
but I had a chance with a real task so I started trying to do it anyway and also due to the nature of the job üòÖ .
If not for the requirement from the job, I still don't know whether I would have any real programming job experience with React.js or not
though I heard about it long time before while I still studied at university as a new modern way to do web development for the UI.

# People

Secondly, important factor that I think is the people we have a chance to work and interact with. Remembering the initial time I trained at the dojo where the senpais who have practiced longer are mostly more
qualified would wait and remind others not to give up before moving onto next sections. Me training alone at that time definitely have close to little will to push myself through the old limit.

During the time at my first job, I was also lucky to have a mentor who helped me during initial working phase in which I was encouraged to start exploring around with the codebase first,
start the simple version first. This helps me avoid falling into tutorial hell in which it is easy to follow instruction but difficult to do it on your own. Additionally, it prevents my tendency to try
finding a perfect solution for a problem since improvement comes later. Needless to say that nothing is perfect and life does not too, (right üòÖ),
there will be time that we will have things in disagreement and we either resolve and move on with or without trade-offs or we part ways , the choice is yours.

# Consistency and Flexibility

Finally I want to remind myself is the commitment of consistency and flexibility on the tactics to the goal not the goal.
For consistency, it means showing up to the thing we need to do daily with the determination to do it and do it well even sometimes we don't feel like it.
It is quite apparent and simple but not easy to do and maintain consistently.

There will be days that you miss but this should not too many, if it is then we need to seriously re-evaluate to correct ourselves.
For flexibility, I think mostly when setting the goal and how to achieve the goals, we might not have enough information to do it the appropriate way.
So we can change the method we use to operate and even the scope of the goal which often is to minimize but not the core.
The topic on flexibility the right way I think deserve the its own separate place and research as each person , and each goal are different.

# Outro

Let's finish this with some of my favorite quotes as well as posts, talks from people that I often revisit as inspirations for myself on the this quest of life üòÜ
