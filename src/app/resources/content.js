      Hi there üëã, welcome to my little digital garden on
      the internet where I will record my learning journey
      in life as a reflection and practicing for my writing

      programming to thoughts formed through reading books,

            In the beginning, I get myself familiar with
            basic task of web development: fix minor UI
            bugs, implement basic UI and server API by
            following instructions from other senior
            members.
          </>,

            <p>
              Later on, I am assigned to a small team of
              three people where we build an internal web
              app relying on a high level WebGL library for
              data visualizaion and interaction.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The app is called <strong>Fork Editor</strong>{' '}
              which handles path generation for an automatic
              Forklift to operate. In this project, I have a
              chance to collaborate and contribute to
              building core UI and functionalities from
              scratch.
            </p>
          </>,
          <>
            <p>
              After that, we continue with tasks converting
              an internal tool built with C++ for Linux into
              a web app based on the motivation of the Fork
              Editor.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              With this one, we used nearly the same tech
              stack as Fork with the addition of gRPC to
              handle the communication between API of the
              original app and the new web app.
            </p>
          </>,
          <>
            <p>
              Finally, I work on a dashboard to manage files
              used by robots as well as other operations.
              The dashboard is part of a system called
              <strong>ROBO-HI</strong> whose vision is a
              central place for robot integration and robot
              management in the future of Japan.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              During this phase, I have more chance working
              at the backend with API and database beside
              the frontend. In this project, we also include
              automation test to reduce bugs for the system.
