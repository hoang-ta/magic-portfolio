      Hi there üëã, welcome to my little digital garden on
      the internet where I will record my learning journey
      in life as a reflection and practicing for my writing
      and presentation. The topics will vary from mostly
      programming to thoughts formed through reading books,
      blog posts, and related stuff on simplicity and
      efficiency in working, design.
      <br />
      <br />
      You can also find me from other places on the internet
      through a list of social links I place at the bottom
      of the page. Let's connect and have some chat üòÜ.
      <br />
      <br />
      By the way, the headline above is my remix of Steve
      Job's quote: "We‚Äôre here to put a dent in the
      universe. Otherwise why else even be here?"
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Besides familiar skills, ideas, I often find it
        fascinating to hear from other renown people talk
        about programming, working methodology so that I can
        expand my world view. At the moment, I'm exploring{' '}
        <strong>Ruby on Rails, TailwindCSS</strong> and will
        later move on to their related tools due to the
        impression on the creators' motivations to strive
        for simplicity but still ensure efficient result in
        the way we work and achiveve results with
        technology.

        complex challenges with simple, and efficient
        solutions. I am inspired to learn new things and
        practice to become excellent at the things I do as

        <br />I have been working as a fullstack web
        developer for {person.yearOfExperience}+ years.
        During this phase, I work with other developers,
        designers, and sometimes with stakeholders to build
        user interface (UI) from Figma design, implement
        server API and database. Additionally I also have a
        chance to work in geospatial field where I do
        visualization and interaction with geospatial data.

            In the beginning, I get myself familiar with
            basic task of web development: fix minor UI
            bugs, implement basic UI and server API by
            following instructions from other senior
            members.
          </>,
          <>
            <p>
              Later on, I work with a small team of three
              people where we build an internal web app
              relying on a high level WebGL library for data
              visualization and interaction. From this
              project, I start participating in code review
              more to improve my skills and learn from other
              members.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The app is called <strong>Fork Editor</strong>{' '}
              which handles path generation for an automatic
              Forklift to operate. In this project, I have a
              chance to collaborate and contribute to
              building core UI and functionalities from
              scratch.
            </p>
          </>,
          <>
            <p>
              After that, we continue with another project
              converting an internal tool built with C++ for
              Linux into a web app based on the motivation
              of the Fork Editor. With previous experience,
              I also have an hornor to mentor new members on
              this project.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              With this one, we used nearly the same tech
              stack as above with the addition of gRPC to
              handle the communication between APIs of the
              original app and the new web app.
            </p>
          </>,
          <>
            <p>
              Finally, I work on a dashboard to manage files
              used by robots as well as other operations.
              The dashboard is part of a system called{' '}
              <strong>ROBO-HI</strong> whose vision is a
              central place for robot integration and robot
              management in the future of Japan.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              During this phase, I have more chance working
              at the backend with API and database beside
              the frontend. In this project, we also include
              automation test to reduce bugs for the system.
