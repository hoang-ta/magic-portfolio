      Recently I have started publishing about things I
      learn and have deep curiosity in as a way for me to
      reflect, remember, improve my writing and public
      presentation . The topics will vary from: programming
      (mostly I think üòù), random thoughts, design (this
      area is where I need to improve most üòÖ), and any new
      things that I randomly find myself interested in.

      Hi there üëã, welcome to my little digital garden on
      the internet where I will record my learning journey
      in life as a reflection and practicing for my writing
      and presentation. The topics will vary from mostly
      programming to thoughts formed through reading books,
      blog posts, and related stuff on simplicity and
      efficiency in working, design engineer.

      By the way, the headline above is my remix of Steve

        I'm {person.firstName} from Vietnam, I look at
        myself as a programmer with a passion for solving
        complex challenges with simple, and efficient
        solutions.
        <br />
        <br />I am a former fullstack web developer with{' '}
        {person.yearOfExperience}+ years of experience in
        web development space where I build user interface
        (UI) from Figma design, to implement server API and
        database. Additionally I also have a chance to work
        in geospatial field where I do visualization and
        interaction with geospatial data.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the moment, I'm looking for a new opportunity
        where I can bring my working programming experience
        to cooperate with people and together learn and
        build products that will leave a positive impact in
        life.

            In the beginning, I get myself familiar with
            basic task of web development: fix minor UI
            bugs, implement basic UI and server API by
            following instructions from other senior
            members.
          </>,
          <>
            Later on, I am assigned to a small team of three
            people where we build an internal web app
            relying on a high level WebGL library for data
            visualizaion and interaction. The app is called{' '}
            <strong>Fork Editor</strong> which handles path
            generation for an automatic Forklift to operate.
            In this project, I have a chance to collaborate
            and contribute to building core UI and
            functionalities from scratch.
          </>,
          <>
            After that, we continue with tasks converting an
            internal tool built with C++ for Linux into a
            web app based on the motivation of the Fork
            Editor. With this one, we used nearly the same
            tech stack as Fork with the addition of gRPC to
            handle the communication between API of the
            original app and the new web app.
